        <p>A recipe is a set of instructions that guide individuals in preparing a particular dish or drink. It typically includes a list of ingredients with specific quantities and a series of steps to follow. The goal of a recipe is to help ensure that the dish is consistently prepared, allowing others to replicate the same flavors and textures.</p>
